<dd>I worked as an admin assistant for four years before and during graduate school so I have excellent business and communication skills and am great at taking criticism whether I deserve it or not. I also worked as a writing consultant in college and in other roles involving writing and speaking e.g. at Stratfor. I speak three languages: English (native), Mandarin (proficiency) and Japanese (proficiency, JLPT Level 2 Certified). My favorite activity is to take my kayak out on Lady Bird Lake in Austin when the lake is full of Herons and Egrets.
