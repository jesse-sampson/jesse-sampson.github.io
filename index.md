Skills and etc.
----------------------------------------
Consulting
: I have maintained an analytics consulting business on and off on the side for several years. Interesting projects have included business intelligence, prediction of late shipping using hazard analysis and unstructured text processing using word2vec as well as H2O's implementation of an autoencoder. 

Programming
: I use SQL and Bash every day and Python and R for scripting and modeling. I use tools like the vagrant-based data science toolkit for ease, scalability and portability. I have given several talks to the Austin useR's Group. I can use APIs and other development tools like Git. I am good at getting and cleaning data from various sources including the wild as well as presentation and visualization.

Etc.
: I worked as an admin assistant for four years before and during graduate school so I have excellent business and communication skills and am great at taking criticism. I worked as a writing consultant in college so I can write and edit well. I speak three languages: English (native), Mandarin (proficiency) and Japanese (JLPT Level 2 Certified). I have demoed in Japanese and Chinese at Ziften too. For hobbies I love reading and spending time outside, especially taking my kayak out on Lady Bird Lake in Austin.
